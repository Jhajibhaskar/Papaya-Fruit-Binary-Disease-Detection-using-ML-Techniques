# Papaya-Fruit-Disease-Detection-using-ML-Techniques
This project aims to classify papaya fruits as healthy or diseased through binary classification. The primary objective is to assist farmers in identifying and managing diseased fruits to promote better crop health and yield.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 30 images of healthy papaya fruits and 30 images of diseased papaya fruits. Each image was resized to 100x100 pixels. However, due to the limited dataset, data augmentation techniques were applied to diversify the dataset. This augmentation involved flipping (3 times) and rotation (3 times) for each original image, resulting in a total of 210 images for each category.
